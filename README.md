# **Ohio-Data-Analysis using Flask and SQLITE3**

A flask app to manage users along with SQLITE3 

First, i have converted the xls file !['data'](https://github.com/Careless-Caramel/Ohio-Data-Analysis/blob/main/20210309_2020_1%20-%204.xls) to a sqlite db file to implement the program. 
     
     `20210309_2020_1-4.xls` -> `data.sqlite3`
      
1. Start by installing all the requirements by the requirements.txt

      `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the file by 

      `python app.py`
      
      
Below is the demo on how to run the API
